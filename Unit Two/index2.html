Private security cameras all across Borough Park tell stories of violence and hatred endured by its Jewish community.<br><br>

In recent weeks, Borough Park has seen a spike in hate crimes committed against Jewish citizens. Two arrests have been made in connection to anti-semitic aggressions in the neighborhood but antisemitic violence has yet to calm down and members of the community have become frustrated with the police.<br><br>

“We’ve sent a very strong message to the police department that there needs to be some serious proactivity on this matter,” said Avi Greenstein, resident and CEO of the Boro Park Jewish Community Council, a social service non-profit that assists Jews and non-Jews alike. <br><br>

“The police department has increased their presence but the Shomrim are the ones spending time with me on a voluntary basis at 12 o’clock on a Saturday night looking at surveillance footage,” he said. “Not the police department.”<br><br>

Shomrim are volunteer community patrol groups common in Orthodox Jewish communities across the country. These groups were not born from tension or violence between police and Jewish citizens, but rather from the community’s belief that they could produce better results by understanding their own neighborhoods, said Daniel Soyer, a professor at Fordham University who specializes in New York’s Jewish history.<br><br>

Deputy inspector of the 66th precinct, James King, said the Shomrim were instrumental in helping with the investigations but believes police are also being proactive.<br><br>

“We’re doing what we can with what we have,” he said. “We’ve brought in police from other precincts and almost quadrupled our manpower [in Borough Park].”<br><br>

Borough Park resident Grace DeVilio Genco said she believes the perception of police apathy has already done damage. Many hate crimes in the community go unreported. <br><br>

“There are many people who say ’no, I’m not going to report this because it’s a waste of time or because the police don’t see it so seriously and let the criminals go when they’re apprehended,’” she said. “For others, the norm, unfortunately, is to not get involved because they feel it’s a whole big hassle.”<br><br>

King said he encourages the community to report every crime they see or experience.<br><br>

“How are we supposed to do anything about crimes we don’t know about?” King said. “I expect the people we arrested to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”<br><br>

Based on the cases that have been brought to NYPD’s attention and documented in their annual hate crime report, anti-semitic hate crimes have gone up in 2019.<br><br>

Currently, NYPD has only released bias-specific hate crime statistics for the first three quarters of 2019, which saw 309 reported incidents across the city. In the first three quarters of 2018, there were 250 hate crimes reported. <br><br>

In both years, anti-Jewish bias was the most common motivation identified by NYPD with 166 incidents in 2019 and 108 in 2018. <br><br>

In Brooklyn’s precincts specifically, reports of anti-Jewish hate crimes increased from 58 in 2017 to 77 in 2018 and 82 in the first 3 quarters of 2019. <br><br>

Only a portion of complaints led to arrests.<br><br>

Although there were 186 complaints of anti-Jewish incidents filed for the full year of 2018, NYPD only made 69 arrests. In the 66th police precinct, there were 14 complaints filed for anti-Jewish hate crimes but only seven arrests made.<br><br>


Despite the rising number of anti-semitic incidents, Greenstein said the community is staying strong.<br><br>

“People are not walking around like victims, let’s be clear about that,” he said. “We go about living our lives. We will continue to do so in a very proud and free way because that’s who we are. We’re resilient and we move on and we grow, we don’t become intimidated by haters.”<br><br><br>
